📂 Small Bash Projects

This project contains a collection of four small Bash scripts, each focusing on basic system administration tasks and process management:

    🔹 User Info Tool:
    A script that allows users to:

        🧑‍💻 Count the number of users currently logged in.

        🧑‍💻 List the names of all currently logged-in users.

        🧑‍💻 Display the groups associated with the current user.

    🔹 Zero-Size File Cleaner:
    A script that prompts the user for a directory path and deletes all files of size zero bytes inside that directory. 🧹

    🔹 Process Management System:
    A script that creates an infinite loop process running in the background. After a set amount of time (20 seconds), it terminates the process automatically. ⏳🔧

    🔹 Grep Command Status Checker:
    A script that simulates a random process success or failure, uses grep to check for the word "true," and makes decisions based on the exit status. 🎯

Each script demonstrates fundamental concepts in Bash scripting such as process handling, conditional logic, file management, and user interaction through the terminal. 🖥️
